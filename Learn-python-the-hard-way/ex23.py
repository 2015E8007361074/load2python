# Ex 23: Read Some Code

"""
1.Finding Python source code for things you need.
2.Reading through the code and looking for files.
3.Trying to understand code you find.
"""

# Here's what you do :

"""
1.Go to bitbucket.org with your favorite web browser and search for "python".
2.Avoid any project with "python 3" mentioned. That'll only confuse you.
3.Pick a random project and click on it.
4.Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and directories until you find a.py file(but not setup.py, that's useless)
5.Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think it does.
6.If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to reseach later.

Now try several three other sites:

1.github.com
2.launchpad.net
3.koders.com
